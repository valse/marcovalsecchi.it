My personal blog. Forked from [Gatsby blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) and take some tweaks from the [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/) version ðŸ˜› (thanks).

Hosted on [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/) take data from my old [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com) site using the [gatsby-source-blogger](https://github.com/valse/gatsby-source-blogger) plugin that I made for this blog.
